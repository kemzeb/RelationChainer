# RelationChainer
RelationChainer is simply in attempt to implement Python's relational operator chaining functionality into a multitude of other programming languages, such as Java, C++, and possibly more to come. This repository also exists for me to become more familiar with the git/github technologies.

These implmentations are by no means to look or be very professonial/efficient (though I still aim for them to be so), moreso a simple challenge I have for some reason became eager to take on after seeing a [Lex Fridman video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPfPFM1wNmE) discussing this interesting Python feature.
